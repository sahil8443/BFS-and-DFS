# BFS and DFS Graphical Visualizer

## Overview
This project is a graphical visualizer for Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. It helps users understand how these graph traversal algorithms work by providing an interactive visual representation.

## Features
- **Graph Creation**: Users can create a custom graph by adding nodes and edges.
- **BFS Visualization**: Step-by-step traversal using the BFS algorithm.
- **DFS Visualization**: Step-by-step traversal using the DFS algorithm.
- **User Interaction**: Add, remove, and reset graph elements dynamically.
- **Intuitive UI**: A clean and simple interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the visualizer.
- **CSS**: Styling for a better user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for graph creation, BFS, and DFS algorithms.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sahil8443/BFS-and-DFS.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.

## Usage
1. Open the visualizer in a browser.
2. Click to add nodes and connect them with edges.
3. Choose either BFS or DFS and click "Start" to visualize the traversal.
4. Reset the graph to start over.
